# memeclub.xyz
Official github reposity of the [memeclub.xyz](https://memeclub.xyz) website

Memeclub is an open-source meme sharing platform with a built in invite system.

I created this website becuase I was tired of 9gag and 4chan and all the other meme sharing platforms currently (2020) out there becuase they became infested with GIFs and Videos - The aim of this platform is to be a static meme repository and sharing website.

The idea was to keep it behind a login as I believe the exclusivity will create demand and drive adoption (this however is not set in stone).

What is set in stone is that no GIFs and Videos must ever be allowed - I know one day when this project becomes bigger my vote and opinion will no longer matter, but like Bitcoin with it's many forks today because Satoshi (Never forget Hal Finney) is no longer here to defend his original vision - I want to make mine clear so that when I die there is no confusion to what my idea and vision was.

### Why Open Source Memeclub.xyz?
* You can't do something great alone. 

### Vision
Be the top meme sharing platform.

### What Memeclub.xyz isn't
* Memeclub.xyz is not a social network and never will be.

### Contribute

Do you want to help? That's awesome. Here are simple things you can do.

#### As a community

* The best way to help is **to actually talk about the project** as much as you can (blog post, articles, Twitter, Facebook). Join [memeclub.xyz](https://memeclub.xyz) and share your invite code with other meme lovers.

#### Contribute as a developer

* Add features and improve the platform 1 line of code at a time. The primary branch will be `MEME-001` 

### To Do
~~// Clean it up~~

~~// Make it open source~~

// Convert to OOP

* Currently the `MEME-001` branch is being developed on by https://github.com/marcoValkyriweb - the aim of this branch is to convert the base project (master branch) to OOP. When I built this app initially I used procedural - that is what I knew, but I realized for this project to grow I will need to convert it to OOP and I am learning that paradigm in this process.

### Requirements
If you want to host it yourself, you need

* PHP 7.2+ or newer
* HTTP server with PHP support (eg: Apache, Nginx, Caddy)
* Composer
* MySQL
